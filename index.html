        <p class="text" id="p2">This section is in charge of providing different ways of entertainment in order that students can have fun and learn new things while they are on their free times; <br>
          some of the aspects included in this section are Sudoku, crosswords, alphabet soup, recommendations of books and movies, curious data in general and also from the school.<br>
           There's going to be a caricature or draw in every edition, this will be made by a student or even a group of students, so if you are good at this, you can participate and send your work of art, the best one will be published in the “curious minds” newspaper section.<br>
          If you are good at other things, such as writing stories or poems whether they are in Spanish or in English, you can participate for publishing it too! <br>
          The main objective of this section is that when students or teachers have free time and they don't know what to do, the first thing that they think about is “curious minds", since this section seeks to generate a “journey to knowledge” through an entertaining way and at the same time present some of the rosarista's talents.
